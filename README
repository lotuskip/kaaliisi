kaaliisi the roguelike version 2 readme file
--------------------------------------------

kaaliisi is a minimalistic roguelike game for Linux. A player character only has
one stat, called "buffness", and the aim of the game is to become as buff as
possible.

Some say a game needs to have a story. I say that's bollocks.

Installation: just run make and hope for the best. You will need the development
libraries for C++ boost and ncurses.

Playing instructions are given in the beginning of the game; simply run it in
your terminal with the command
	./kaaliisi
(or just 'kaaliisi' if you installed it in your path.)

The game was developed for Linux only. Suggestions and/or bug reports can be
sent via email to <onnir the-at-sign-here iki and-the-dot-comes-here fi>
but I make no promises that they would invoke any kind of action from my part.

About the source:
-----------------

First of all, if you want to enjoy the game at all, please don't jump straight
into reading the source; that would be very spoily.

Most of the code was written way back, without much plans, and is really messy.
Until recently, lack of interest kept me from finishing the game. And then when
I decided to finish it, I had a really hard time figuring out my old code. So
it's a mess still.

There are still some display bugs, but mostly due to bad design. They're more
of an annoyance; the game is fully playable.
